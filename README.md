# GoAI

中文简介：

`GoAI` 是一个基于 `KataGo` 引擎制作的围棋娱乐项目，重点不是严肃比赛，而是“好玩、爽快、容易上手”。除了普通对弈模式，它还加入了两种更偏游戏化的玩法：

- `Rogue` 模式：开局三选一卡牌，围绕节奏、陷阱、补子、限制 AI 等效果展开
- `Ultimate` 模式：更夸张的大招卡牌，强调短局、高爆发、强演出

这个项目主要面向 Windows 普通玩家，优先考虑“安装简单、启动稳定、没有 NVIDIA 也能玩”。当前版本支持：

- 有 NVIDIA 时优先尝试 `CUDA`
- 无 `CUDA` 时回退 `OpenCL`
- `OpenCL` 不可用时回退 `CPU`

English summary:

`GoAI` is a hobby Go/Weiqi game project built on top of the `KataGo` engine. It is designed more as a fun playable experience than as a serious tournament or research tool.

- `Rogue Mode`: pick 1 out of 3 cards at the start of the game
- `Ultimate Mode`: fast, flashy, overpowered card battles

The Windows build aims to be easy to install, stable to start, and able to fall back from CUDA to OpenCL or CPU on ordinary machines.

## Project Positioning

- This is a fan-made hobby project, not an official KataGo GUI.
- It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by the KataGo project.
- The maintainer is a Go enthusiast, not a professional software engineer.
- For transparency: the code in this project was developed with heavy AI coding assistance, mainly using tools such as `Claude Code` and `Codex`, while the maintainer provided gameplay ideas, testing, packaging goals, and iteration direction.

## Main Features

- Normal AI play with multiple strength presets
- Rogue card mode
- Ultimate overpowered card mode
- Windows desktop launcher
- FastAPI backend + browser frontend
- CUDA / OpenCL / CPU fallback

## Intended Use

This project is intended for:

- casual play
- friends and family entertainment
- experimental roguelike-style Go gameplay ideas

This project is not intended for:

- official tournaments
- benchmark-style engine comparisons
- claiming any official relationship with KataGo

## Runtime Environment

Recommended environment for source development:

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.11
- a modern browser
- optional GPU

Python packages used by the source version include:

- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn[standard]`
- `websockets`

Build / packaging tools used by this project:

- `PyInstaller`
- `Inno Setup 6`

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use a packaged Windows release

If you only want to play, the easiest way is to use the packaged Windows installer from the project Releases page.

### Option 2: Run from source

1. Install Python 3.11.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare the `katago/` directory.

This source repository intentionally does not include large third-party engine binaries, neural network weights, or NVIDIA runtime DLLs by default for repository cleanliness and licensing caution. See `katago/README.md` for expected files.

4. Run the backend:

```bash
python server.py
```

5. Or run the launcher:

```bash
python launcher.py
```

## Third-Party Credits

Core third-party components used by this project include:

## Repository Policy

To keep the GitHub repository smaller and easier to review:

- source code stays in Git
- logs, build outputs, local test files, models, and packaged binaries stay out of Git
- packaged installers should be attached to GitHub Releases rather than committed into the source repository

## Friendly Note

This project was built with enthusiasm first and polish second. The goal is simple: make a playful, approachable Go game that more people can install and enjoy.
